# BPMN2Constraints

Tool for compiling BPMN models directly to constraints.
Currently, BPMN2Constraints can compile BPMN models stored in both `JSON` and `XML`
format and output to `DECLARE`, `SIGNAL`
and `Linear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces` (LTLf).
BPMN2Constraints can also compile BPMN diagrams to Mermaid.js compatible flowcharts.

The original repository is available [here](https://github.com/signavio/bpmn2constraints), 
and is developed by SAP Signavio.

A tutorial that provides a walk-through of how to use the tool in
an SAP Signavio context is provided [here](./tutorial/tutorial.ipynb).
